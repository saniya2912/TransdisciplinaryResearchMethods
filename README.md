# Malaysian Meal Kit Adoption Study — Mixed-Methods Research

This repository contains the full materials, data structure, and documentation for a mixed-methods research project exploring the factors that influence **Malaysian immigrant parents’ perceptions and adoption of recipe meal kit services in the UK**.

The study examines key factors such as **convenience, ease of preparation, delivery efficiency, authenticity of flavour, dietary compatibility, ingredient freshness, packaging, and value for money**, using a **convergent parallel mixed-methods design**.

## 🔍 Study Overview

- **Client Context:** HelloFresh UK  
- **Target Population:** Malaysian immigrant parents living in the UK  
- **Research Question:**  
  *What factors shape Malaysian immigrant parents’ perceptions and adoption of meal kit services?*

### 📘 Mixed-Methods Design (Convergent Parallel)

**Qualitative Strand**
- Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) during real-time meal preparation  
- Contextual inquiry during and after cooking  
- Follow-up semi-structured online interview  

**Quantitative Strand**
- General survey measuring cooking habits, cultural expectations, meal-kit attitudes, and demographic patterns  

Both strands are conducted in parallel and integrated at interpretation.

## 📊 Methods Workflow

The research process follows the pipeline below:

1. Recruitment → Screener  
2. Meal kit delivery / doorstep visit  
3. **EMA during cooking** (Microsoft Forms)  
4. Post-cook micro-survey  
5. **Follow-up online interview**  
6. Parallel quantitative survey  
7. Convergent synthesis and interpretation  
8. Final reporting
